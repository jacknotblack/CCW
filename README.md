# NFT Asset List and NFT Detail

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Available route

### `/list`

This page displays your assets with infinite scroll. Each time it fetches 20 assets. Click on the asset and you will be redirect to the detail of the NFT.

### `/detail/[contract_address]/[token_id]`

This page displays the detail of an NFT. Click go back to get back to the last page or click permalink button to redirect to its permalink page.

## Known issues

### MetaMask pending

If a user with metaMask extension opens the site and refresh page before neither connect nor reject, after refresh there will be an error `Request of type 'wallet_requestPermissions' already pending`. This now will be treated as rejection since we cannot know when or if the user will eventually connect / reject. 

We might possibly hold and prompt user to respond on the extension.
